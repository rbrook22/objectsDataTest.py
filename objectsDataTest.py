# What would you use to find a numberâ€™s square root, as well as its square?

# Given the string 'hello' give an index command that returns 'e'. Enter your code in the cell below:

# s = 'hello'
# # Print out 'e' using indexing
# Reverse the string 'hello' using slicing:

# s ='hello'
# # Reverse the string using slicing
# Given the string hello, give two methods of producing the letter 'o' using indexing.

# s ='hello'
# # Print out the 'o'
# # Method 1:

# # Method 2:

# Build this list [0,0,0] two separate ways.
# # Method 1:

# # Method 2:

# Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead:
# list3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]

# Sort the list below:
# list4 = [5,3,4,6,1]

# Using keys and indexing, grab the 'hello' from the following dictionaries:
# d = {'simple_key':'hello'}
# # Grab 'hello'
# d = {'k1':{'k2':'hello'}}
# # Grab 'hello'
# # Getting a little tricker
# d = {'k1':[{'nest_key':['this is deep',['hello']]}]}

# #Grab hello
# # This will be hard and annoying!
# d = {'k1':[1,2,{'k2':['this is tricky',{'tough':[1,2,['hello']]}]}]}

# Use a set to find the unique values of the list below:

# list5 = [1,2,2,33,4,4,11,22,3,3,2]
